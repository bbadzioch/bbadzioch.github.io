# Getting Started With Jupyter Notebook

Follow the instructions below to install Jupyter Notebook and learn its basis functionality.


**1)** Install the [Anaconda distribution of Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
(be sure to select the 3.7 version).

If you have Anaconda previously installed, make sure that it includes Python 3.6
or 3.7, and fairly recent versions of the the Jupter Notebook and the following
Python packages: sympy, numpy, matplotlib, bokeh, pandas, requests, beautifulsoup4.
Upgrade if needed. If you are installing Anaconda for the first time, you don't
need to worry about it, everything is included in the distribution.  

**2)** A part of the Anaconda distribution is the Jupyter Notebook app.  
It can be launched by typing:

```jupyter notebook```

in a terminal (Mac and Linux)  or command prompt (Windows). Once you execute
this command, a web browser will open showing Jupyter Notebook dashboard.  Here is a short
video which demonstrates basic features of the Jupyter Notebook. Watching the first
4 minutes, on how to create a new notebook and work with markdown and code cells,
is enough to get started.
