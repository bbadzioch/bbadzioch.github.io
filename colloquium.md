**Title:** Two adventures in integrable systems: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with non-trivial 
boundary conditions 

**Abstract:** A significant advance in mathematical physics in the second half of the twentieth century was the development of the theory of modern integrable systems.  These systems are nonlinear evolution equations of physical significance that provide the nonlinear counterpart to the classical PDEs of mathematical physics.

One such equation, and in some respects the most important one, is the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation.  The NLS equation is a universal model for weakly nonlinear dispersive wave packets, and arises in a variety of physical settings, including deep water, optics, acoustics, plasmas, condensed matter, etc.  In addition, the NLS equation is a completely integrable, infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, and as a result it possesses a remarkably deep and beautiful mathematical structure.  At the root of many of these properties is the existence of Lax pair, namely the fact that the NLS equation can be written as the compatibility condition of an overdetermined pair of linear ODEs.  The first half of the Lax pair for the NLS equation is the Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem, which is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem for a one-dimensional Dirac operator.

Even though the NLS equation has been extensively studied throughout the last sixty years, it continues to reveal new phenomena and offer many surprises.  In particular, the focusing NLS equation with nontrivial boundary conditions has received renewed attention in recent years.  This talk is devoted to presenting two recent results in this regard.  Specifically, I will discuss: (i) A characterization of the universal nonlinear stage of modulational instability, achieved by studying the long-time asymptotics of solutions of the NLS equation with non-zero background; (ii) A characterization of a two-parameter family of elliptic finite-band potentials of the non-self-adjoint ZS operator, which are associated with purely real spectrum of Hill's equation (i.e., the time-independent Schrodinger equation with periodic coefficients) with a suitable complex potential.

**Title:** Brave new fixed-point theory 
**Abstract:** The development of algebraic topology in the 20th century could be characterized as a gradual passage from combinatorial, numerical invariants such as the Betti numbers to group-valued invariants such as homology, and then from homological algebra to spectral or "brave new" algebra in the latter half of the century. In brave new algebra, integers are replaced by maps of spheres. What is amazing is that just about every concept in algebra can be transformed to accommodate this new paradigm.

The effects of this development continue to ripple through topology and nearby subjects, including the very classical topic of Nielsen fixed-point theory. I'll explain how work of Dold in the 1970s and of Ponto in the 2000s and 2010s infused the "brave new" perspective into fixed point theory. The result is that, amazingly, we can now work with the Lefschetz number and its generalizations without ever triangulating or mentioning homology groups, and the definitions now generalize easily to parametrized families of fixed-point problems.
