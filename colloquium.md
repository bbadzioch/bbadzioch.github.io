**Title:** Two adventures in integrable systems: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with
non-trivial boundary conditions 

**Abstract:** A significant advance in mathematical physics in the second half of the twentieth century was the development of the theory of modern integrable systems.  These systems are nonlinear evolution equations of physical significance that provide the nonlinear counterpart to the classical PDEs of mathematical physics.

One such equation, and in some respects the most important one, is the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation.  The NLS equation is a universal model for weakly nonlinear dispersive wave packets, and arises in a variety of physical settings, including deep water, optics, acoustics, plasmas, condensed matter, etc.  In addition, the NLS equation is a completely integrable, infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, and as a result it possesses a remarkably deep and beautiful mathematical structure.  At the root of many of these properties is the existence of Lax pair, namely the fact that the NLS equation can be written as the compatibility condition of an overdetermined pair of linear ODEs.  The first half of the Lax pair for the NLS equation is an eigenvalue problem for the Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem, which is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem for a one-dimensional Dirac operator.

Even though the NLS equation has been extensively studied throughout the last sixty years, it continues to reveal new phenomena and offer many surprises.  In particular, the focusing NLS equation with nontrivial boundary conditions has received renewed attention in recent years.  This talk is devoted to presenting two recent results in this regard.  Specifically, after a general introduction, I will discuss: (i) A characterization of the universal nonlinear stage of modulational instability, obtained studying the long-time asymptotics of solutions of the NLS equation; (ii) A characterization of a two-parameter family of elliptic finite-band potentials of the non-self-adjoint ZS operator, which are associated with the purely real spectrum of Hill's equation with a complex potential.
