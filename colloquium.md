**Title:** Brave new fixed-point theory 

**Abstract:** The development of algebraic topology in the 20th century could be characterized as a gradual passage from combinatorial, numerical invariants such as the Betti numbers to group-valued invariants such as homology, and then from homological algebra to spectral or "brave new" algebra in the latter half of the century. In brave new algebra, integers are replaced by maps of spheres. What is amazing is that just about every concept in algebra can be transformed to accommodate this new paradigm.

The effects of this development continue to ripple through topology and nearby subjects, including the very classical topic of Nielsen fixed-point theory. I'll explain how work of Dold in the 1970s and of Ponto in the 2000s and 2010s infused the "brave new" perspective into fixed point theory. The result is that, amazingly, we can now work with the Lefschetz number and its generalizations without ever triangulating or mentioning homology groups, and the definitions now generalize easily to parametrized families of fixed-point problems.

**Title:**  Quantum symmetries of graphs and non-local games.

**Abstract:** Given a finite graph X, a fundamental question that one can ask about the structure of X is: "What are its symmetries?" 
Most of the time, when we think of symmetries of X, the usual automorphism group of X comes to mind.  In this talk, 
I will describe a more general notion of symmetry of graphs, called quantum symmetries.  Quantum symmetries of graphs 
arise quite naturally within the framework of non-commutative geometry and are encoded by a certain universal Hopf algebra 
(i.e., quantum group) co-acting on the algebra of functions on the vertex set of the graph.  Very recently, quantum symmetries 
of graphs have also been found to arise within the context of two-player non-local games in quantum information theory.  
More precisely, they encode winning entangled strategies for the so-called graph isomorphism game.  I will give a light introduction to 
all of these ideas and highlight how tools from non-local games and representation theory combine in a very powerful way to elucidate 
the structure of graphs, their quantum symmetries, and related operator algebra problems.

**Title:** Two adventures in integrable systems: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with non-trivial 
boundary conditions 

**Abstract:** A significant advance in mathematical physics in the second half of the twentieth century was the development of the theory of modern integrable systems.  These systems are nonlinear evolution equations of physical significance that provide the nonlinear counterpart to the classical PDEs of mathematical physics.

One such equation, and in some respects the most important one, is the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation.  The NLS equation is a universal model for weakly nonlinear dispersive wave packets, and arises in a variety of physical settings, including deep water, optics, acoustics, plasmas, condensed matter, etc.  In addition, the NLS equation is a completely integrable, infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, and as a result it possesses a remarkably deep and beautiful mathematical structure.  At the root of many of these properties is the existence of Lax pair, namely the fact that the NLS equation can be written as the compatibility condition of an overdetermined pair of linear ODEs.  The first half of the Lax pair for the NLS equation is the Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem, which is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem for a one-dimensional Dirac operator.

Even though the NLS equation has been extensively studied throughout the last sixty years, it continues to reveal new phenomena and offer many surprises.  In particular, the focusing NLS equation with nontrivial boundary conditions has received renewed attention in recent years.  This talk is devoted to presenting two recent results in this regard.  Specifically, I will discuss: (i) A characterization of the universal nonlinear stage of modulational instability, achieved by studying the long-time asymptotics of solutions of the NLS equation with non-zero background; (ii) A characterization of a two-parameter family of elliptic finite-band potentials of the non-self-adjoint ZS operator, which are associated with purely real spectrum of Hill's equation (i.e., the time-independent Schrodinger equation with periodic coefficients) with a suitable complex potential.

**Title:** Phase and phase-amplitude reduction for stochastic oscillators

**Abstract:** Phase reduction is a powerful and widely used tool for studying synchronization,
entrainment, and parametric sensitivity of limit cycle oscillators. The
classical phase reduction framework goes back at least 50 years for
deterministic ODE systems. In both natural and engineered systems, however,
stochastic dynamics are ubiquitous.  For stochastic systems, the appropriate
analog of phase reduction remains a matter of debate. In 2013 Schwabedal and
Pikovsky introduced a notion of phase reduction for stochastic oscillators based
on a first-passage-time analysis. In 2014 Thomas and Lindner introduced an alternative
asymptotic phase for Markovian stochastic oscillators based on a spectral
decomposition of the Koopman operator (a.k.a. the generator of the Markov process,
or the adjoint Kolmogovor operator). I will report on recent advances in
understanding and expanding these ideas, including (i) reformulation of the
first-passage-time (FPT) phase in terms of the solution of a partial
differential equation with nonstandard boundary conditions, (ii) quantitative
comparison of the FPT and spectral phase for planar stochastic systems, and
(iii) extension of the spectral phase to a novel "phase-amplitude" reduction for
stochastic oscillators.

This is joint work with Benjamin Lindner (Humboldt University, Dept. of Physics
and Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience) and Alberto Perez-Cervera
(Complutense University of Madrid, Dept. of Applied Mathematics).
