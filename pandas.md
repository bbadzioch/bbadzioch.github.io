# IAD Days 2023
# Pandas Workshop


##  General information

* Pandas is a Python library for processing tabular data, such as data stored in Excel
  spreadsheets, CSV files etc. The main goal of this workshop is to provide an introduction
  to basic pandas functionality and show examples how it can be used in practice.

* While prior programming experience will be helpful, it is not required for this workshop.
  Pandas can be a very useful tool for anyone dealing with data.

* This will be a hands-on workshop - we will write and execute code the entire time.
  All participants should bring laptops. Any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) is fine.
  We will be coding in Python, with Jupyter notebook as the programming environment. This
  is freely available sotware. Instructions how to install it are posted below.

* Please feel free to contact me with any questions at

## Software installation

**1)** Install the [Anaconda distribution of Python 3.9](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

**2)** A part of the Anaconda distribution is the Jupyter Notebook app.  It can be launched by typing:

```jupyter notebook```

in a terminal (Mac and Linux)  or command prompt (Windows). Once you execute
this command, a web browser will open showing Jupyter Notebook dashboard.  Here is a short
video which demonstrates basic functionality of Jupyter Notebook (watching the first
4 minutes or so should be enough to get started):
