# IAD Days 2023
# Pandas Workshop


##  General information

* Pandas is a Python library for processing tabular data (such as data stored in Excel
  spreadsheet, CSV files etc.). The main goal of this workshop is to provide an introduction
  to basic pandas functionality and show examples how to use it in practice.

* While prior programming expericence will be useful, it is not required.

* This will be a hands-on workshop - we will write and execute code the entire time.
  All participants should to bring laptops. Any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux) is fine.
  We will be using Python and Jupyter notebook as a programming environment.
  Instructions how to install this software and additional are posted below.

## Software installation

**1)** Install the [Anaconda distribution of Python 3.9](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

**2)** A part of the Anaconda distribution is the Jupyter Notebook app.  It can be launched by typing:

```jupyter notebook```

in a terminal (Mac and Linux)  or command prompt (Windows). Once you execute
this command, a web browser will open showing Jupyter Notebook dashboard.  Here is a short
video which demonstrates basic functionality of the Jupyter Notebook (watching the first
4 minutes or so will be enough for now):
